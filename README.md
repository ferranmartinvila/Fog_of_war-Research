<h1 id="INTRO"> Introduction </h1>
<p>Fog of war is a common concept found in many combat-based real-time and turn-based strategy games. It simulates the unknowns of the battle and provides an exploration incentive to uncover them, forcing the player to rely on imperfect and incomplete information of the battlefield and sometimes improvise based on intuition and common sense.</p>
<p>Here we are going to talk about the concept of the Fog of War and all its variables, the origins, how board games and videogames adapt the concept to engage the user, and finally a tutorial of how to do a fog of war for an RTS game.</p>

<h1 id="CONCEPT"> Fog of War Concept </h1>
<p>The fog of war is a term used to describe the uncertainty in the situation experienced by participants in military operations. It isn’t limited at the own capability, so it determinates the adversary capability too.</p>

<p>So fog of war is directly related with the fog in a real battle camp and the ambiguity that it generates, but when this concept is transferred to the world of games is not necessary simulated with fog. </p>

<p>For example, in Battleship the famous board game, there’s no fog but the concept of war ambiguity is present, in fact, is the principal feature of the game.</p>

<p>In videogames is practically the same. It’s true that a lot of videogames simulate the fog of war concept directly with fog but some videogames use other methods. For example, BRAIN / OUT is a shooter that simulates the war ambiguity hiding the players that aren’t doing noisy actions.</p>

<p>Now that we know what really means Fog of War let’s talk about the different ways in which the ambiguity can affect the user and change the game flow.</p>
