<h1 id="INTRO"> Introduction </h1>
<ul>
<p>Fog of war is a common concept found in many combat-based real-time and turn-based strategy games. It simulates the unknowns of the battle and provides an exploration incentive to uncover them, forcing the player to rely on imperfect and incomplete information of the battlefield and sometimes improvise based on intuition and common sense.</p>
<p>Here we are going to talk about the concept of the Fog of War and all its variables, the origins, how board games and videogames adapt the concept to engage the user, and finally a tutorial of how to do a fog of war for an RTS game.</p>
</ul>

<h1 id="CONCEPT"> Fog of War Concept </h1>
<ul>
<p>The fog of war is a term used to describe the uncertainty in the situation experienced by participants in military operations. It isn’t limited at the own capability, so it determinates the adversary capability too.</p>

<p>So fog of war is directly related with the fog in a real battle camp and the ambiguity that it generates, but when this concept is transferred to the world of games is not necessary simulated with fog. </p>

<p>For example, in Battleship the famous board game, there’s no fog but the concept of war ambiguity is present, in fact, is the principal feature of the game.</p>

<p>In videogames is practically the same. It’s true that a lot of videogames simulate the fog of war concept directly with fog but some videogames use other methods. For example, BRAIN / OUT is a shooter that simulates the war ambiguity hiding the players that aren’t doing noisy actions.</p>

<p>Now that we know what really means Fog of War let’s talk about the different ways in which the ambiguity can affect the user and change the game flow.</p>
</ul>

<h1 id="TYPES"> Fog Types </h1>
<p>The ambiguity that the fog of war generates can vary according to the level at which participants are engaged.</p>
<p>The different ambiguity levels are:</p>
<ul>
<li><h5> Grand Strategic </h5></li>
<ul>
<p>Ambiguity is related to the political intent, capabilities and logistical strengths of an adversary. Basically we know that there’s an adversary but we don’t know nothing about it. </p>
<p>A game with this type of fog of war is Age of Empires II. Where we know all about our civilization but nothing about the enemy.</p>

</ul>
<li><h5> Military Strategic </h5></li>
<ul>
<p>Ambiguity is related to the structure, strength, capability, and disposition of own and adversary offensive and defensive assets. The own assets ambiguity can be generated by a bad report of it or unwillingness to watch for them. </p>
<p>A good example of this fog type is Call of Duty MW3 in hardcore mode. In normal mode the user knows the location of the allied players and the avatar stats, as you can see in the first screenshot. But in hardcore mode the minimap and all the UI related with the stats is hidden as you can see in the second screenshot. So the second frame simulates the military strategic ambiguity.</p>

</ul>
<li><h5> Operational </h5></li>
<ul>
<p>Ambiguity is related with the adversary like the grand strategic but is coupled with own directive ambiguity. So the commander doesn’t have the full sight of the strategic imperative</p>
<p>The example game is Dragons of Atlantis. In this game you can send your units to attack the enemy, but you don’t know the result of the operation since the units return to your domains or a messenger is send.</p>
<p>The first screenshot shows the order and the second shows the result.</p>
